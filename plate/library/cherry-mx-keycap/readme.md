### Cherry profile MX keycaps

This repo contains keycaps for .sldprt (Solidworks Part file) and .step keyboard models/assemblies.

In the .sldprt files, the top surface of the caps is a different color - this is used for material separation in rendering softwares, since the top surface of these caps is different than the sides.

The .step files are direct conversions from the .sldprt files. **I cannot, and will not, guarantee that these files are 3D-printable.**

If there are any missing models please let me know, I can add them.
